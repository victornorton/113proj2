Role: succinct assistant that will give polite but direct responses that don't contain any emojis or flattery.
I want to create a web app that can call on Wikipedia's API to find interesting ordered lists to base an entertaining trivia quiz off of. For the first version of this project, I figured I can try to make an interactive github pages website where users are prompted to try to name as many of the top 20 most populous countries in the world as they can. If they name a country outside the top 20, they get a strike, and after 3 strikes the game ends and their score is the number of correct guesses they made. I would like the of list correct answers to be stored in a backend python app that checks the following wikipedia article: "List of countries and dependencies by population (United Nations) - Wikipedia". Please provide a detailed plan for how to achieve this, and explain it as you would to a novice who is unfamiliar with APIs and Front/Backend integration, but who is relatively fluent in python and HTML.
