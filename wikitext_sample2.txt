This is a '''list of countries and dependencies by population'''. It includes [[sovereign state]]s, inhabited [[dependent territory|dependent territories]] and, in some cases, constituent countries of sovereign states, with inclusion within the list being primarily based on the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard [[ISO 3166-1]]. For instance, the [[United Kingdom]] is considered a single entity, while the constituent countries of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] are considered separately. In addition, this list includes certain [[list of states with limited recognition|states with limited recognition]] not found in ISO 3166-1. Also given in a percentage is each country's population compared with the [[world population]], which the [[United Nations]] estimated at 8.232 billion as of 2025.<ref name="UNFPA">{{cite web |url=https://www.unfpa.org/data/world-population-dashboard |title=World Population Dashboard |year=2024 |work=United Nations Population Fund |publisher=UNFPA |access-date=29 September 2024}}</ref>

Figures used in this chart are based on the most up-to-date estimates or [[population projection|projections]] by the national [[census]] authority, where available, and are usually rounded off.

Where updated national data are not available, figures are based on the estimates or projections for 2024 by the Population Division of the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]].

Because the compiled figures are not collected at the same time in every country, or at the same level of accuracy, the resulting numerical comparisons may create misleading conclusions. Furthermore, the addition of figures from all countries may not equal the world total.

Areas that form integral parts of [[sovereign state]]s, such as the [[countries of the United Kingdom]], are counted as part of the sovereign states concerned. Not included are other entities that are not sovereign states, such as the [[European Union]],{{efn|The European Union is a ''[[sui generis]]'' [[supranational union]] whose sovereign members delegate to it by treaty certain powers that are often exercised by sovereign states. Its combined population has been estimated at 447,319,916 on 1 January 2020, and it would be ranked 3rd if it were included in the list. It has {{#expr: 447319916 / {{worldpop}} * 100 round 2}}% of the world's population — see {{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tps00001/default/table?lang=en |title=Eurostat-Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface（TGM）table|publisher=[[European Commission]]}}}} and independent territories that do not have permanent populations, such as the [[Chagos Archipelago]] and [[territorial claims in Antarctica|various countries' claims]] to [[Antarctica]].<ref>{{cite web |title=World Population Prospects – Population Division – United Nations |url=https://population.un.org/wpp/ |access-date=4 September 2022 |publisher=population.un.org |archive-date=5 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190205234912/https://population.un.org/wpp/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Sovereign states and dependencies by population ==
Note: A numbered rank is assigned to the 193 [[member states of the United Nations]], plus the two [[United Nations General Assembly observers#Current non-member observers|observer states to the United Nations General Assembly]]. Dependent territories and constituent countries that are parts of sovereign states are not assigned a numbered rank. In addition, [[list of states with limited recognition|sovereign states with limited recognition]] are also included, but not assigned a numbered rank.
